Repository to investigate Apple Health Data.

# Motivaiton

Devices within the iOS ecosystem collect a wide variety of data. Apart from the limited information exposed via the [Health App](https://www.apple.com/au/ios/health/) (along with some 3rd party apps) however, there isn't a mechanim for the user to easily investigate the reams of historical data available. This repository aims to levelrage open source tools avaialable on macOS along with the control over health data that the user has, to better process this data and convey valuable information.
